# Hints for client developers (using the C# client library)

### UpdateTransceivers(...)

- Call immediately if:
	- One or more frequencies change
	- One or more transceivers are removed
	- One or more transceivers are added
	- One or more transceiver IDs change
	- An aircraft 'reposition' event occurs from the simulator (if applicable)
- Call on a 5 second interval if:
	- One or more transceivers are moving
	
### TransmittingTransceivers(...)

- Call immediately if:
	- One or more transceivers change 'TX' state
	
### PTT(bool active)

- Call immediately if:
	- User begins PTT
	- User ends PTT
	
### Aliasing

Recap from Gary, Ross, Justin chats...

Whenever a controller comes within range, or goes out of range, or changes his primary frequency, I perform the following checks to see if I need to tune an HF freq
I iterate over all in-range controllers, looking for one who's primary frequency (normalized) matches the one that is tuned in either of my COM radios
if I find any (realizing there may be multiple), I check each of them against the database of positions which have alias frequencies
in that check, the callsign must fuzzy match
and the frequency must match the controller's non-normalized frequency
if any such match is found, I tune that positions HF frequency
a fuzzy match is where the callsign prefix and suffix match, but the stuff in the middle of the callsign (if any) does not have to match
